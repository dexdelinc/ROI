                    Prevention</h4>
                <p>Most utilities already have a variety of enterprise networks and legacy operational technology (OT)
                    networks in use. The utility industry has well-established practices for securing these networks,
                    including the Purdue Model, Zero Trust Architecture principles, and best practices like visibility,
                    security monitoring, and breach detection. But unfortunately, these practices cannot be extended to
                    LTE networks due to significant architectural differences that create security blind spots and other
                    new risks to critical infrastructure.</p>
                <p>With OneLayer’s solution, you’ll get a comprehensive set of capabilities, bridging between the IT/OT
                    & cellular network, and providing OneLayer of security. </p>
                <p>OneLayer product provides the following capabilities and value, and much more:</p>
                <ul class="ms-5">
                    <li>Device Identity and Monitoring Blind Spots - Real-time identification and fingerprinting of all
                        cellular network devices, including device type, location, activity, inter-networks identity
                        matching, etc.</li>
                    <li>Enhance the visibility and control of existing security tools, including the visibility and
                        control of devices behind cellular routers or CPEs (no solution does this for cellular routers
                        today)</li>
                    <li>Deploy granular Zero Trust segmentation policies on Private 5G & LTE networks, including setting
                        policies for devices behind a router</li>
                    <li>Geo-fencing devices using location-based policies</li>
                    <li>Geo-fencing devices using location-based policies
                        Quickly detect and remediate 5G/LTE device vulnerabilities, such as Impersonation, SIM Swap,
                        Anomalies, Device misbehavior, Signaling storm, Authentication failures, and so on</li>
                    <li>The equivalent in IT/OT environments would be IoT security solutions such as Dragos(OT),
                        Claroty(OT), and Armis(IT/OT).</li>
                    <li>Enterprises who would like to build it alone would need a combination of firewalls, managed NW
                        switches, manual configuration of the Cellular Core PCF/PCRF, and much consulting to achieve
                        some alternative segmentation capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To quantify these capabilities’ value, we used a formula, looking at a security budget of an
                    organization for securing its private cellular network. And the specific budget parts related to
                    security solutions.</p>

                <p> With OneLayer’s solution, most of these activities will be automated. It will save a lot of precious

                <ul class="ms-5">
                    <li>Reducing the effort invested in policy configuration, maintenance, deployment, and enforcement.
                        SecOps teams could now quickly and automatically set segmentation and policies and simplify
                        posture validation.</li>

                        policy for better security hygiene</li>
                    <li>Dynamic custom groups allow an automatic policy for new devices. Once a new device is added, the
                        policy will adapt accordingly, automatically. For example, I have a group of “all the tablets on
                        Cell #5”. Once another tablet connects to Cell #5, it will get the relevant policy.</li>
